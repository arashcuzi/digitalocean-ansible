# digitalocean-ansible

This is a good README, but it needs a bit more...

### Reasons

This playbook is created as a demo of Digital Ocean's API for creating droplets on the fly using Ansible.

### Requirements

Must have Ansible installed:

Let's install PIP first, as it's the easiest way to install Ansible.

```
$ sudo easy_install pip
```

Then run:

```
$ sudo pip install ansible
```
